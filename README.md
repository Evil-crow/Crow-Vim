### Crow'Vim

*For a long time , I want to use the .vimrc that coded by myself*

*But I don't have enough time before Now ,I think I can't stand here*

*I must do somrthing. Because I have lost my favorite girl before this way*

*So,I decided to learn VimScript and coding the .vimrc myself*

**Welcome to clone my .vimrc,and I'll be happy to see some bugs that have been comminting**

**Well,Let's start and fighting!**
